# Archived/Restart

14/01/2025 It's been ages since I've done any advent of code, so I've basically forgotten it all! So I decided to shunt all my old code into this archive folder, reorganise my solutions by language, and go from there.

## Order of solutions

Probably helpful to have an approximate list of the order in which I wrote solutions.
Dates can be found by looking at the commit history, if you are so inclined. 

- 2015 days 1--11, mostly in C++, little bit of CL and Haskell. 
- 2022 day 1 in C++ AND CL, because why not I guess? 
- 2023 day 1 in Haskell (very hacky)
- 2023 day 2 in Clojure (new language!)
- 2023 day 3 in C++
- 2015 day 12 in C++, basic JSON parser :D
- 2015 day 14 in C++
- 2015 day 13 in C++
- 2015 day 16 in C++
- 2015 day 18 in C++
