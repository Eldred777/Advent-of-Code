# Advent-of-Code
Hello. Here are my solutions to Advent of Code. I am going through previous years for fun, and thought I may as well share my solutions. I like to switch up my language when doing them, so I'll often implement the same problem in different languages; this includes learning new languages or new packages for fun!

I restarted AoC on 14/01/2025 on something of a whim; previous solutions are available in the archive folder. A big part of this is I wanted a cleaner file structure separated by language, since Java, Rust and Clojure at least all benefit from being in their own project directories.
