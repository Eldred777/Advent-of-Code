# Advent-of-Code
Hello. Here are my solutions to Advent of Code. I am going through previous years for fun, and thought I may as well share my solutions. I like to switch up my language when doing them, so I'll often implement the same problem in different languages; this includes learning new languages or new packages for fun!

## Order of solutions

Probably helpful to have an approximate list of the order in which I wrote solutions, in case you want to see how my coding has developed.
Dates can be found by looking at the commit history, if you are so inclined. 

- 2015 days 1--11, mostly in C++, little bit of CL and Haskell. 
- 2022 day 1 in C++ AND CL, because why not I guess? 
- 2015 day 12 in C++ 
- 2023 day 1 in Haskell (very hacky)
- 2023 day 2 in Clojure (new language!)
